# TodoApp (Getting Started with .Net & EF Core Web APIs)

Eversince the announcement of Microsoft making .Net open source and cross platform, I wanted to experiment writing an app using .Net and EF core on Mac. This is my first step diving into backend development. Since I'm primarily a mobile developer, I've written a Todo Web Api that can be consumed by clients including mobile apps.

This project will be used to experiment and implement main .Net core features to get intermediate level understanding.

### Tech Details
- Uses .Net Core 1.1
- EF core integrated with SQLite database
- Development IDE: Visual Studio Code

## Upcoming
I'm planning to write a blog post for beginners, this project will be used as reference.
